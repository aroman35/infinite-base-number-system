# Infinite Base Number System (IBNS Theory)

## Overview
The **Infinite Base Number System (IBNS)** is a novel mathematical framework introducing **individually-parameterized infinities**.  
Each real number generates its own infinity, enabling a structured extension of arithmetic where division by zero becomes a well-defined mapping:

$$
\frac{x}{0} = \infty_x
$$

IBNS generalizes classical number systems by constructing:
- first-order infinities  
- higher-order infinities  
- tensor and matrix infinities  
- algebraic rules for operations between infinities  
- structured intersections and parallelism of infinities  
- IBNS-based calculus (differentiation and integration)

All core axioms, algebra, and calculus definitions follow a consistent formal structure designed for research, experimentation, and theoretical exploration.
